# ML Algorithms from Scratch!

> Machine Learning algorithm implementations from scratch.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Linear Regression [click here](Linear-Regression.ipynb)
- Logistic Regression [click here](Logistic-Regression.ipynb)
- Naive Bayes [click here](Naive-Bayes-Classification.ipynb)
- KNN Classifier [click here](Naive-Bayes-Classification.ipynb)

## Roadmap

- Implement Perceptron, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means, AdaBoost, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Add more solvers
- Different optimization function & technique
- More optimizations, vectorized operations and tweaks

**NOTE!!**: This is for demonstrative purpose only, and is not optimized for the best performance
