## Roadmap

- Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest, AdaBoost and Gradient Boost
- Add more solvers
- Different optimization function & technique
- More optimizations & better vectorized operations and tweaks

**NOTE!!**: This is for demonstrative purpose only, and is not optimized for the best performance
